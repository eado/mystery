Thanks for decoding that message. Now, you're the one who's going to
have to listen...

Hint: Create a server that listens on any address at port 3738.

NETSIFT INTERVIEW PROBLEM (CONFIDENTIAL):
Here's a sequence of bits from an HDLC connection:
110011 1110011 110011 000111

From left to right, these bits form an ASCII string.
Each grouping of bits is a character with its *least significant bit* first. 

HDLC uses bit stuffing with a sentinel pattern 01111110.
Any time it sees a sequence of 5 1s in a row, it inserts a 0.
Your job is to "unstuff" these bits.

Hint: If the answer is 2467, send GET /2467
